  A gate for subsetting flow cytometry data.

  If you use a gate to subset (mask) a population that does not contain the
  gate's dimensions, the result of that gating operation is `nil`.

  Conforming to the Gate Protocol
  ===============================

  To add `Gate` conformance to your type, you must declare the following
  requirements: 

  * The `dimensions` property
  * The `masking(_: Population) -> Population?` method

  - SeeAlso: `Population`
